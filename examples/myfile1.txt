I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, tho' not
of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settl'd firstat
Hull.  He got a good estate by merchandize, and leaving off his trade, liv'd
afterwards at York, whence h had marry'd my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was call'd
Robinson Kreutznaer; but by ths usual corruption of words in England, we are
now call'd, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name Crusoe, and so my
companions always call'd me.
