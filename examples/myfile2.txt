I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieutenant colonel to an English
regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was kill'd at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.
What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what was become of me.
